How many people separate you and the president? This is what people in Hollywood theorized, that there is at most 6 degrees of separation from any given actor/actress to Kevin Bacon. They mean that those who acted with Kevin Bacon have 0 degrees of separation, while if an actor acted with someone who acted with Kevin Bacon but not with him, they have one degree of separation.
This determines how many degrees any given actor/actress has from another, by using a node system that explores actors via BFS. As such, this may take a while. I suspect it could be made faster by prioritizing the processing of more prolific actors over less prolific ones.
